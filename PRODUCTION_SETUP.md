# Checkmate Production Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you prepare the Checkmate app for production deployment with real Plaid credentials and optimized configuration.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Production Checklist

### 1. Plaid Production Credentials
- [ ] Sign up for Plaid production account at [plaid.com](https://plaid.com)
- [ ] Create your production app in Plaid Dashboard
- [ ] Obtain your production `client_id` and `secret`
- [ ] Complete Plaid's production review process
- [ ] Add production webhook endpoints (if needed)

### 2. Environment Configuration
Replace the placeholder credentials in `.env.production`:

```bash
# Update these with your actual Plaid production credentials
EXPO_PUBLIC_PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_production_client_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_PLAID_SECRET=your_actual_production_secret
EXPO_PUBLIC_PLAID_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### 3. App Store Configuration
Update `app.json` with your actual information:

```json
{
  "ios": {
    "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.checkmate", // Change to your domain
    "buildNumber": "1" // Increment for each release
  },
  "android": {
    "package": "com.yourcompany.checkmate", // Change to your domain
    "versionCode": 1 // Increment for each release
  }
}
```

### 4. EAS Build Configuration
Update `eas.json` submit section with your Apple Developer account:

```json
{
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "appleId": "your-apple-id@example.com",
        "ascAppId": "your-app-store-connect-app-id",
        "appleTeamId": "your-apple-team-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- ‚úÖ Production Plaid credentials are properly secured
- ‚úÖ Debug mode disabled in production
- ‚úÖ API keys are not exposed in client code
- ‚úÖ All sensitive data uses secure storage

### Permissions
- ‚úÖ Camera permission (for receipt scanning)
- ‚úÖ Microphone permission (for voice notes)
- ‚úÖ Location permission (for merchant categorization)
- ‚úÖ Network access (for bank connections)

### Data Protection
- ‚úÖ All financial data encrypted at rest
- ‚úÖ Secure token storage using Expo SecureStore
- ‚úÖ HTTPS-only communication
- ‚úÖ PCI DSS compliance through Plaid integration

## üöÄ Build Commands

### Development Build
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### Production Build
```bash
eas build --profile production --platform ios
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

### Submit to App Stores
```bash
eas submit --profile production --platform ios
eas submit --profile production --platform android
```

## üß™ Testing Production Builds

### 1. Staging Environment
Use `.env.staging` for testing with Plaid sandbox:
- Test all bank connection flows
- Verify transaction sync functionality
- Test error handling scenarios
- Validate offline mode behavior

### 2. Production Testing
Before release:
- [ ] Test with real bank accounts (small amounts)
- [ ] Verify all Plaid webhooks work correctly
- [ ] Test app performance under load
- [ ] Validate security compliance
- [ ] Test on multiple device types

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring (Optional)

### Add Analytics Services
Update environment variables with your keys:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_KEY=your_analytics_key_here
```

### Recommended Services
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Amplitude/Mixpanel**: User analytics and behavior tracking
- **Firebase Analytics**: App usage metrics

## üîÑ Plaid Webhook Configuration

### Production Webhooks
Set up webhook endpoints for real-time updates:

1. **Transaction Updates**: `/webhooks/plaid/transactions`
2. **Item Status**: `/webhooks/plaid/item`
3. **Error Notifications**: `/webhooks/plaid/error`

### Implementation
The app currently handles polling for transaction updates. For production scale, implement webhook handlers for:
- New transactions
- Account updates
- Item reconnection needed
- Error notifications
