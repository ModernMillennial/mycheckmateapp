# Plaid Integration Setup

## Overview
Checkmate now includes full Plaid integration for real bank account connections. The app automatically falls back to demo mode when Plaid credentials are not provided.

## Features Added
- ✅ **Real Bank Connection** - Connect to 11,000+ financial institutions
- ✅ **Automatic Transaction Import** - New transactions sync automatically
- ✅ **Multiple Account Support** - Connect checking, savings, and credit accounts
- ✅ **Smart Transaction Matching** - Manual entries convert to bank transactions
- ✅ **Demo Mode Fallback** - Works without Plaid credentials for testing
- ✅ **Bank-Level Security** - 256-bit encryption and OAuth 2.0

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Plaid Credentials
1. Sign up for a [Plaid account](https://plaid.com)
2. Create a new app in the Plaid Dashboard
3. Get your `client_id` and `secret` keys
4. Choose environment: `sandbox` (testing) or `production` (live)

### 2. Add Environment Variables
Add these lines to your `.env` file:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_plaid_client_id_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_PLAID_SECRET=your_plaid_secret_here
```

### 3. Configure Environment
In `src/services/plaidService.ts`, update the baseUrl:
- **Sandbox**: `https://sandbox.plaid.com`
- **Development**: `https://development.plaid.com`
- **Production**: `https://production.plaid.com`

## How It Works

### Without Plaid Credentials (Demo Mode)
- App works fully with mock bank data
- "Connect Bank" shows demo connection flow
- Demo transactions are imported automatically
- All features work for testing and development

### With Plaid Credentials (Real Mode)
- Real Plaid Link integration launches
- Users connect to actual banks
- Real transactions are imported
- Bank balances sync automatically

## User Flow

1. **Tap "Connect Bank"** from hamburger menu
2. **Choose Institution** from 11,000+ supported banks
3. **Login Securely** with bank credentials (handled by Plaid)
4. **Select Accounts** to connect
5. **Import Transactions** from last 30 days automatically
6. **Sync Ongoing** - new transactions appear automatically

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Added/Modified:
- `src/services/plaidService.ts` - Core Plaid integration
- `src/components/PlaidLink.tsx` - Plaid Link component
- `src/screens/BankConnectionScreen.tsx` - Connection UI
- `src/state/transactionStore.ts` - Plaid state management
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added Plaid access token storage

### Security Features:
- Bank credentials never stored on device
- Access tokens encrypted in secure storage
- All API calls use HTTPS
- Follows PCI DSS compliance standards

## Testing

### Demo Mode Testing:
1. Don't add Plaid credentials to `.env`
2. Use "Connect Bank" - will show demo flow
3. Demo bank "Demo Bank" will be connected
4. Mock transactions will be imported

### Real Plaid Testing:
1. Add Plaid sandbox credentials to `.env`
2. Use "Connect Bank" - real Plaid Link opens
3. Use Plaid test credentials:
   - Username: `user_good`
   - Password: `pass_good`
4. Real test transactions will be imported

## Error Handling
- Network errors fall back to demo mode
- Invalid credentials show user-friendly messages
- Transaction sync failures are handled gracefully
- All errors are logged for debugging

## Production Considerations
- Use production Plaid environment
- Implement proper error tracking
- Consider webhook endpoints for real-time updates
- Add account re-authentication handling
- Implement proper access token refresh logic

## Benefits for Users
- **No Manual Entry** - Transactions import automatically
- **Always Accurate** - Real bank balances
- **Multi-Bank Support** - Connect multiple institutions
- **Smart Matching** - Manual entries become bank-confirmed
- **Bank-Grade Security** - Same security as banking apps
